Problem Statement:

Given a graph with nodes representing women and weighted edges representing the petrol required to travel between them, find the optimal path for a man to meet the women while maximizing the total rating and obeying the following rules:

The man has a limited amount of petrol in his car.
The man cannot meet neighboring women (directly connected by an edge) because they talk to each other and may get upset.
The woman's rating is given as the amount of love the man has for her.
Write a C++ program to find the optimal path and the maximum total rating of the women the man can meet.

Input:

n (1 <= n <= 100): the number of women (nodes)
m (0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2): the number of edges between women
petrol (0 <= petrol <= 1000): the amount of petrol the man has in his car
m lines, each containing:
u, v (1 <= u, v <= n): the indices of two women (nodes) connected by an edge
w (1 <= w <= 100): the petrol required to travel between these women
n lines, each containing:
rating (1 <= rating <= 100): the amount of love the man has for each woman
Output:

The maximum total rating of the women the man can meet.
